# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Add Your own Experience

You can add your own experience by feeding data into data.js

# AirBnb Experience Website

1. AirBnb Experience website was built on create-react-app template
2. It uses React & CSS3
3. Data.js contains purely the data related to the card components
4. Cards.js with the help of CSS Styles renders the card on the landing page
5. App.js then collates Navbar.js, Landing.js & Cards.js together and exports to index.js
6. Index.js renders the page.
7. There are 2 images folder: one in public directory & one in components folder
8. Public directory is where all the card's images which are fetched from data.js are stored
9. Components folder contains the static images like airbnb logo, collage and the star.

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
